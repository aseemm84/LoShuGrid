        **Analysis Request:**
        Please provide a comprehensive reading covering the following aspects:
        
        ## Core Personality Analysis
        ### Psychic Number ({psychic})
        Explain what the Psychic number reveals about their inner self, desires, and basic character.
        ### Destiny Number ({destiny})
        Explain what the Destiny number reveals about their life's purpose, path, and the lessons they are here to learn.
        ### Name Number ({name_number})
        Explain what the Name Number (derived from '{name}') reveals about their talents, abilities, and potential in the world. This is their mode of expression.
        ### Kua Number ({kua})
        Briefly explain what the Kua number suggests about their personal energy and compatibility with directions.
        
        ## The Lo Shu Grid Breakdown
        ### Strengths (Based on Present Numbers)
        Analyze the meaning of the numbers present in their grid ({grid_data}). What strengths and talents do these numbers indicate?
        ### Challenges (Based on Missing Numbers)
        Analyze the meaning of the numbers missing from their grid ({missing_numbers}). What challenges or areas for growth do these absences suggest?
        
        ## Analysis of Planes
        ### Completed Planes Analysis
        If there are completed planes ({completed_planes_str}), explain the powerful characteristics and abilities these bestow upon the individual.
        ### Guidance for Missing Planes
        If there are no completed planes, offer constructive advice on how the person can compensate for the energies of missing planes in their life.
        
        ## Summary and Overall Guidance
        Provide a concluding summary that synthesizes the key points of the reading. Offer one or two key pieces of actionable advice for {name} to lead a more fulfilling life based on their unique numerological chart.
